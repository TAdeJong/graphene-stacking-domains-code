# Graphene stacking domains code
Jupyter notebooks to generate the figures related to stacking domains in few layer graphene, both in twisted bilayer graphene and in graphene on SiC.

# TODO

- Add environment and make consistent
- integrate code generating GPAQFBLGoverview.pdf from GPA-CQFBLG into the map_overlap version.
- Convert data to shareable format and add references
- In the end re-add the ipynbs
- Obtain DOI via zenodo
- Some more stuff I am forgetting right now
