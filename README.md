# Graphene stacking domains code


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/510656254.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/510656254)


Jupyter notebooks to generate the figures related to stacking domains in few layer graphene, both in twisted bilayer graphene and in graphene on SiC.

The code in `morphology` generates the figures for T.A. de Jong _et al._ "Stacking domain morphology in epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide", [Phys. Rev. Materials 7, 034001 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.034001) 	([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14623)).

The code in `spectroscopy` generates the figures for T.A. de Jong _et al._ "Low-Energy Electron Microscopy contrast of stacking boundaries: Comparing twisted few-layer graphene and strained epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide", [Phys. Rev. B 107, 075431 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.075431) ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14616)).


# Data

Data for the morphology part can be found at [4TU.researchdata](https://doi.org/10.4121/21930768).

# TODO

- Add environment and make consistent
- integrate code generating GPAQFBLGoverview.pdf from GPA-CQFBLG into the map_overlap version.
- Some more stuff I am forgetting right now
